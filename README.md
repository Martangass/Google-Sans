# Google-Sans
Here u can find the Google Sans Font. it's not available at normal font library's. U can download and link it in ur HTML file.

I used in my Chrome Update Popup for maleware..


Locate the file in ur code folder.

Than u can link it in the Header data with the code below.

```
<link rel="stylesheet" src= google-sans-font.css>
```

# Google-Sans
Here you can find the Google Sans Font. it's not available in normal font library's. You can download and link it in your HTML file.

I used it in my Chrome Update Popup for maleware..


Locate the file in your code folder.

Than you can link it in the Header data with the code below.

```
<link rel="stylesheet" src="google-sans-font.css">
```
